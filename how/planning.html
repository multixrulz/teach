<h1>Being ready to teach a lesson</h1>
<p>When you walk into a room to meet a group of students, you need to know what you’re going to do with them.  How do you do that?</p>
<p>Planning happens on at least three levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#scope-sequence">An entire year’s teaching and learning.</a></li>
<li><a href="#unit">A unit of work</a> (that is, a well-defined piece of the subject)</li>
<li><a href="#lesson">The lesson</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Before you even think about planning, you really need to know <a href="how-we-learn.html">how people learn</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="scope-sequence">Planning an entire year’s teaching and learning</h2>
<p>This is also known as a scope and sequence, and it’s not particularly interesting.  The syllabus tells you what you need to teach for the year (that is, the scope).  The scope and sequence is just a listing of the units you plan to teach, and how long they’re going to take, such that the requirements of the syllabus are met.</p>
<h2><a id="unit">Planning a unit</h2>
<p>This is where you spend most of your planning time.</p>
<p>There’s an overwhelming amount of information out there about how to teach.  There are so many things you’re supposed to think of when you do your planning.  So far I haven’t found a documented process for bringing in all of those things at an appropriate time, and I want one so that I don’t end up falling back to a few basics and neglect some really good stuff.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="how-we-learn.html">Allow your brain to work for you</a> – spend smaller amounts of time over a longer period (like 2 hours a day for a week).  Your brain can work on things in the background and come up with solutions over time.</p>
<p>Because of this, planning a unit is not a strictly linear process.  Be prepared to come back to earlier stages as new good ideas pop into your head.</p>

</ul>
<h3><a id="unit-outcomes">What’s the goal? Where are you headed?</h3>
<p>What are the outcomes you’re looking for?  What should your students know/do/understand at the end of the unit?</p>
<ul>
<li>Start with the syllabus/curriculum outcomes.</li>
<li>Create smaller, contextualised outcomes, as syllabus outcomes are frequently too general.</li>
<li>For example, science syllabi have content that you can use to develop outcomes.</li>
<li>You need to address<ul>
<li><a href="/facts/">Facts</a> e.g. spelling, times tables.</li>
<li><a href="/skills/">Skills</a> e.g. how to multiply, how to measure water.</li>
<li><a href="/ideas/">Ideas</a> e.g. place value, texts have a particular purpose.  The 6 facets of understanding from <a href="refs/ubd.html#6facets">Understanding by Design</a> help here.<ul>
<li>explain</li>
<li>interpret</li>
<li>apply</li>
<li>shift perspective</li>
<li>empathise</li>
<li>self-assess</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="blooms-taxonomy.html">Bloom’s Taxonomy</a> is useful at this stage to work out the level of thinking you’re targetting at each outcome.</li>
<li>&lt;&mdash; Include intercultural understanding and representation of diversity</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="unit-assessment">Create assessments</h3>
<p>You won’t be completing the creation of all of your assessments here, but you need to start working on them, particularly the formal assessments.</p>
<p>When creating assessments, remember <a href="inclusivity.html">inclusivity</a>.  Is the assessment fair to all students?</p>
<h4>Formative Assessment</h4>
<p>Assessment for marks is quite useless for learning, as you probably won’t come back to that exact type of task again. The whole point of teaching is for students to learn.  Therefore you need to know if they are learning as you go along.</p>
<p>You need to be tracking how <strong>all</strong> of the students are going as <strong>often</strong> as possible – at the very least, once per lesson.  At this point you’re not creating lessons, but you do need to create many formative assessments that can be used in lessons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer back to your outcomes.</li>
<li>Design the formative assessment as carefully as the assessment tasks.<ul>
<li>Prepare specific questions to ask, or tasks to perform, so that you don’t muck it up by trying to create it in the moment.</li>
<li>When you expect to need to observe students, make a note in your plan to remember to do this.</li>
<li>Don’t panic. These are small tasks, so they won’t need as much time to develop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use an <a href="all-student-response.html">All student response</a> method.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Assessment Tasks</h4>
<p>These are the test, assignments, performances etc. that students know they are being marked on.</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer back to your outcomes.</li>
<li>If you’re thinking of doing a long-running project as an assessment, look down at the “designing learning activities” section too.</li>
<li>
<p>Planning a performance task? Understanding by Design lists the <a href="refs/ubd.html#grasps">GRASPS elements</a> to assist here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a marking rubric.</p>
<ul>
<li>My preference is to have a larger number of fairly well-defined items in the rubric. This makes it clear – at least to you ­– what is being marked.</li>
<li><a href="refs/ubd.html#rubric">Understanding by Design</a> has a nice way of thinking about how to differentiate the different levels in a rubric.</li>
<li>Try using a framework (e.g. SOLO) &lt;&mdash; come back to this and list them out better, and link to them</li>
<li>Make sure you have some wriggle room for unexpected work (but really, if the rubric is good this shouldn’t happen):<ul>
<li>A way to pass the entire assessment if it is actually good, but somehow doesn’t tick the other boxes.</li>
<li>A way to fail the entire assessment if it is way off mark but still manages to tick the other boxes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="unit-students-know">What do the students already know? Where are we starting from?</h3>
<p>This is absolutely critical knowledge (see <a href="how-we-learn.html#net-of-knowledge">the net of knowledge</a>) and can be hard to come by. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things you assume, therefore can’t rely on<ul>
<li>What <em>should</em> they already know, based on prior schooling?</li>
<li>What are their interests?</li>
<li>What cultural assets do they have?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Things you can know with a fair amount of certainty<ul>
<li>What have I already taught and verified that the students have learned?</li>
<li>Can I pre-test to find out?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="unit-setup">Set up the material for learning</h3>
<h4>Use knowledge of how we learn</h4>
<p>You’re going to help students build new parts of their <a href="how-we-learn.html#net-of-knowledge">nets of knowledge</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add knowledge piece by piece. You might need to think hard here about what the pieces are.<ul>
<li>Chunking &lt;&mdash; elaborate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Find metaphors you can use to explain the new knowledge, to link it to existing knowledge.</li>
<li>Use stories.</li>
<li>Plan for spaced repetition and interleaving.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sequence the learning</h4>
<p>Isolated knowledge cannot be learned effectively.</p>
<p>Sequence the learning such that each piece of new knowledge connects to existing knowledge, either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#unit-students-know">knowledge the students had before you started</a></li>
<li>knowledge earlier in your sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a id="unit-activities">Design learning activities</h3>
<p>Take your chunks and sequence and design learning activities for them.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll need to create your own contextualised outcomes (also known as Learning Intentions).<ul>
<li>WALT/WILF can be helpful here, although these are more focused on <a href="/skills/">skills</a> and ignore <a href="/facts/">facts</a> and <a href="/ideas">ideas</a>.<ul>
<li>WALT – <strong>W</strong>e <strong>a</strong>re <strong>l</strong>earning <strong>t</strong>o</li>
<li>WALT – <strong>W</strong>hat <strong>I</strong>’m <strong>l</strong>ooking <strong>f</strong>or)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Generate activity ideas</h4>
<ul>
<li>You might like to use a framework such as<ul>
<li>The <a href="5Es.html">5Es</a></li>
<li>Project-based learning</li>
<li>Just-in-time learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activity idea generators &lt;&mdash; flesh out / reference other pages<ul>
<li>MI</li>
<li>Cooperative</li>
<li>Primary Connections facilitation techniques</li>
<li>The strategies thing I got in one of the EDIT subjects</li>
<li>Thinkers Keys</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Evaluate and refine activity ideas</h4>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research-backed strategies &lt;&mdash; (HITS, what works best, 7 Secrets, maybe some formative assessment stuff too). Create pages for these.</li>
<li>Cognitive Load Theory - contributes to the net of knowledge idea.</li>
<li>6 learning things (learning scientists / QBI)</li>
<li>Scaffolding - Genre Pedagogy TLC, Vygotsky&rsquo;s ZPD</li>
</ul>
<p>Also remember <a href="inclusivity.html">inclusivity</a>.  Will the activities be accessible to all students?</p>
<h3><a id="unit-writeup">Write it up</h3>
<p>Write out your unit plan.  Using a template is a great idea.</p>
<p>Be sure to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include enough detail that you could easily write out individual lesson plans from it, in a mostly copy/paste fashion.</li>
<li>Include:<ul>
<li>reasons for why you’ve made particular decisions</li>
<li>the purpose of the various activities and how they fit in to the unit</li>
<li>resources that you’re going to need</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t plan a unit down to specific lessons.  Things just won’t turn out how you expect.  Leave that flexibility for lesson planning.</p>
<h2><a id="lesson">Planning a lesson</h2>
<p>As you get near to a particular lesson, plan it out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide which activities (or parts of activities) are going to fit into lessons.</li>
<li>Get your resources together. One of my resources is a digital journal file.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A digital journal program lets you use a touchscreen computer like a paper notebook.  I set up a journal file for each lesson.  It contains things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>headings to remind me what to talk about</li>
<li>blank spaces for me to draw or write</li>
<li>pictures and illustrations I’ll need</li>
<li>links to videos and websites</li>
<li>notes for the students to copy</li>
<li>visual sequence organisers for students to refer to when doing independent activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The journal file lets me combine most of the things I’m going to need for a lesson into one file.  After a lesson, I can save the file and keep it for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>giving to students (especially for those who were away)</li>
<li>a record of what happened in the lesson, particularly handy for evaluation</li>
<li>history, in case I forget to sign the unit register</li>
</ul>
<p>The big downfall of this idea is when you have naughty kids who muck about with your interactive board.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use hinge questions – these are questions in a lesson that let you know if you’re winning, or if you need to go back and try teaching the same thing a different way.</li>
</ul>
<p>The day before your lesson, make sure phototopying has been done, and other physical resources have been collected and prepared.</p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>
<p>(These are rough notes)</p>
<ul>
<li>Flipped learning - turns class time into tutorial sessions instead of lectures. Students can revisit old stuff, or catch up on time they lost.</li>
<li>Gamify - for motivation. I&rsquo;m also thinking this can be useful to let kids know that they have actually learned stuff, so they can approach a test with confidence (and also so I can assess them on continual achievement instead of assessment task performance).</li>
<li>Plan in active recall, spaced repetition, etc.</li>
<li>WAGOLL</li>
<li>Collect formative assessment data</li>
</ul>
