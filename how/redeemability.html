<h1>Ensuring absence doesn’t jeopardise education</h1>
<p>When students are absent from school, they not only miss one day’s learning — all of the later activities that depended on learning things that day are also affected.  Students can start down a vicious cycle of negative thinking and self-jeopardising behaviours if they miss a lot of school and find that they can’t do things.  How can we make it possible to recover from an absence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t yet have a good framework or resources about this.  I’ve just done some websearching and noted a few things I thought of myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some ideas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flipped learning — swapping the in-school and homework activities.</li>
<li>Students access the “explanation” part of the classroom experience by some method other than by live experience with the teacher.  Options include:<ul>
<li>Reading a book, website, etc.</li>
<li>Watching a video (of you, or something you’ve found).</li>
<li>Using an online learning website.</li>
<li>Reading materials you’ve put together.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The in-class activities operate more like a tutorial</li>
<li>Put as much as possible online (e.g. class website, Google classroom) so students who were away can find out what happened.</li>
<li>Or you could do this physically, with pigeon holes or trays.</li>
<li>Gamification can help track who’s done what.  It allows more personalised pathways through a course. Allow students to follow their own paths through the course as much as possible, rather than making everyone do the same thing in every lesson.</li>
<li>Assigning “Absence buddies”, so each student has someone looking out for them when they’re away.  The absence buddy collects handouts etc. and gets the absent student up-to-date on what they missed when they return.</li>
<li>Make yourself available outside of scheduled classes, so students can come to you to catch up.</li>
</ul>
